# MonKernel-Package
My kernel package for CC Tweaked that enables automation of multi-speaker and multi-monitors setups
- S for ShellEmu (running shell programs as normal from within the kernel
- L for LockMenu (setting up dedicated Redstone Door Locks)
- C for xCommand (the main menu)
- X for xServer commands (remote panicing of machines)
- M for MultiMonitor config menu

  You MUST run 'devInitAll' from xCommand to initialize peripherals for the first time after connecting.
  There seems to be no limit on monitors
  There is a limit of 8 speakers per computer in parallel.
